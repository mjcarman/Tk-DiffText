Revision history for Perl extension Tk::DiffText.

0.13 (2006-11-19)
    * Uses less memory. (Diffs now performed directly on contents of ROText
      widgets.) This added a dependency on Tie::Tk::Text (new module).
    * Added load() and compare() methods. diff() now deprecated.
    * Panes are scroll-locked after being compared, unlocked whenever a pane is
      loaded.

0.12 (2006-11-15)
    * Intra-line differences now use the key generation function. (i.e. they
      respect settings to ignore case and whitespace.)

0.11 (2006-11-14)
    * Fix test suite to work better cross platform
    * Initialized gutter width to minimal size on creation
    * Renamed -colors option to -diffcolors

0.10 (2006-11-12)
    * original version released on CPAN
