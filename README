Tk-DiffText
===========

This module defines a Perl/Tk composite widget that makes it simple to provide 
basic "diff" functionality to your Tk applications.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

  Perl 5.005
  Tk 800
  Algorithm::Diff
  Tie::Tk::Text
  IO::File

Algorithm::Diff and IO::File are "soft" requirements. Tk::DiffText is usable 
without them but will suffer from degraded functionality.
